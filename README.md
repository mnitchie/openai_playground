# OpenAI Playground

Just playing around with the OpenAI api

## Getting started

1. Make sure you have an API key and credits for you API account on OpenAI
2. `cp env.template .env` and fill in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your key
3. `devcontainer open .` for vscode, (or do a virtualenv if you prefer)
